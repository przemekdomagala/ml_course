2. **Classification** - Implementation of classification algorithms.
3. **Regression** - Various regression techniques and their applications.
4. **SVM** - Support Vector Machines for classification and regression tasks.
5. **Trees** - Decision trees and related algorithms.
6. **Ensemble** - Ensemble methods like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting.
7. **Clusterization** - Clustering algorithms for unsupervised learning.
8. **Measurements** - Metrics and methods for evaluating model performance.
9. **Keras** - Deep learning projects using Keras.
10. **Hyperparameters** - Techniques for hyperparameter tuning and optimization.
11. **CNN** - Convolutional Neural Networks for image processing tasks.
12. **RNN** - Recurrent Neural Networks for sequential data.
